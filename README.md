# teachers-app

Teachers app is an ongoing closed source side project, providing a teacher oriented task managment software, free to use and accessible [here](https://teachers-toolkit.herokuapp.com/)

## Stack

The app was created using a Node (Express) + React Stack and a PSQL Relational Database. It uses a REST API for communication between server and clients and an ORM (Sequalize) for communication between the database and the backend. Along with several middleware such as dotenv + passport for secure authentication and securely storing secrets and more.

More information about the skeleton can be found in my open source repo found [here](https://github.com/abbaswork/react-express-template)
